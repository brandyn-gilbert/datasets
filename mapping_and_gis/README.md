# Datasets for use in mapping and GIS applications

## What's included in this repository
* [Nine Mile Run Watershed Association](https://ninemilerun.org/) came in to talk to DAT-201 in Fall 2019, and they brought some excellent local data sets and a set of very good questions that students could explore, alone or in teams. Their data sets and questions are in a subfolder of this directory. (Coral or Eric can probably give you a little bit of an introduction to what's there from memory, and we can put you in touch with a really nice person from NMRWA if you want to ask questions of them.)
* [fixed_neighborhoods.zip](./fixed_neighborhoods.zip) - This is the set of Pittsburgh neighborhood shapefiles from [WPRDC](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset), but with the neighborhood that has a broken geometry fixed, to make practice easier. (Coral did report the broken file to WPRDC, a couple of semesters ago.)

## External data providers you might want to check out
* [Pennsylvania Spatial Data Access (PASDA)](https://www.pasda.psu.edu/) - All kinds of shapefiles relevant to Pennsylvania
* [TIGER/Line Shapefiles](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.html) - Legal boundaries for US Census Bureau data, pretty much necessary for mapping anything by Census tract or Census block group.
