# Datasets

This is a collaborative list of datasets that CCAC Data Analytics students and faculty have found useful, broken up (loosely) by topic/application. (It's OK if a link shows up in more than one place. For files, let's try to only host them in one location.)

## Some of our favorite data providers

* [Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center (WPRDC)](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset) - Lots of good open data relevant to Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, and the surrounding region
