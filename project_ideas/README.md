## Project ideas brainstormed by Spring 2020 DAT-201 students:

* Laws passed (voted on? sponsored?) by individual legislators and how that correlated with their district's wealth
* Distribution of building permits and neighborhoods in Pittsburgh
* Wealth of neighborhoods and highway proximity
* Pizza places per capita in US cities (possibly solving an argument between proponents of Chicago and NY)
* Wealth vs. school ratings
* Number and/or size of companies in various municipalities
* Election results - margins by which various candidates won/lost
